"""Extract data on near-Earth objects and close approaches from CSV and JSON files.

The `load_neos` function extracts NEO data from a CSV file, formatted as
described in the project instructions, into a collection of `NearEarthObject`s.

The `load_approaches` function extracts close approach data from a JSON file,
formatted as described in the project instructions, into a collection of
`CloseApproach` objects.

The main module calls these functions with the arguments provided at the command
line, and uses the resulting collections to build an `NEODatabase`.

You'll edit this file in Task 2.
